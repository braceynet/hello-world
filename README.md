I enjoy coding and learning new things. My favorite part of coding is troubleshooting issues with other people's code to help them find the issues they are having trouble identifying.
I don't have a favorite scripting language, but I am familiar with Java and C++.  I am currently studying Python and hope to develop my skills to the point that I am programming my own applications and can eventually teach at a university.
